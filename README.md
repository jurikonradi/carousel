# Carousel component

## Requirements:

- Must work for mobile and desktop devices
- Must support swipes
- Must work for any HTML content
- Must be animated, finger-following swipes, you can use a multi-picture post in Instagram as a reference.

## Advantages:

- Supports multiple slides on the screen
- Supports infinite option
- Supports scrolling to a selected slide (like go to slide X)
- Any optimizations related to performance are welcome and appreciated!

## Also:

- Using any runtime libraries is prohibited except for the react core itself and CSS-in-JS approach allowers.
- Using environment setup automatizers (like create-react-app) is prohibited.
- Submitting any code that is not written by you

## HTML Elements

- each HTML element must have its own .sass file. Names of styles must be unique in each .sass file. For example: 'ElementHtml01.js' component styles, described in 'ElementHtml01.sass' file, has '.element-html-01-container' class. So in another ElementHtml02.sass file (for ElementHtml02.js component) similar class should have another name, for example '.element-html-02-container'.
- avoid using 'body', 'h1' - 'h5', 'button' styling tags, as they will overwrite your document styles. Instead use 'body className='body-html-element-01' and '.body-html-element-01'.
